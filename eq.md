To generate a probability density function (PDF), we need to specify the distribution we are working with. Some common probability distributions include the normal (Gaussian), exponential, binomial, and Poisson distributions, among others. 

Let's consider an example of generating the probability density function for a normal (Gaussian) distribution. The PDF of a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ is given by:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \cdot e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

where:
- $x$ is the variable
- $\mu$ is the mean
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation

Let's say we have $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$, we can generate the PDF for this standard normal distribution.
